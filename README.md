# DISJOINT-SET-OPERATIONS
1) Implemented Union-Find algorithm By Rank and Path Compression using height balanced AVL tree without any limitation of space.
   Time Complexity for this algorothm is O(log(n)).
2) Implemented set operations of AVL tree using split and join algorithm.
   Time complexity O(m.log(n/m + 1)) where m and n are size of two AVL tree.
